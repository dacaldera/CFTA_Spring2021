# Module 1.5

## Did you know...
* the second(), minute(), hour(), day(), month(), and year() functions return just that which they are named for. note: they are written in singular form
* the map() function takes one value and a range and then maps it over to a new value and range. *map(0.5, 0, 1, 0, 100)* maps the value "0.5" from the range "0 to 1" into the range "0 to 100", and returns the value 50. [map() reference](https://processing.org/reference/map_.html) 

## Color Modes
* The colorMode() function is used to specify which color mode to use inside the processing sketch. There are TWO modes: RGB and HSB
* RGB corresponds to RED/GREEN/BLUE, and is the default color mode [RGB-STYLE CHART](https://ps3.perlenspiel.net/images/rgbrect.png)
* HSB corresponds to HUE/SATURATION/BRIGHTNESS [HSB COLOR WHEEL DIAGRAM](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M0-KLgIQowgQ2sRmRGm%2F-M04eXfov2q8lvkrzSfw%2F-M04ebTAIaSz9auBk8R2%2FHSB_Cone.png?alt=media)
* When changing the color mode with the colorMode function, there is the option of defining a range for each mode's values. For example: colorMode(RGB, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) will make it so that instead of using values between 0 and 255 for each color, you can use values between 0 and 1.0. 
* A common range for HSB values is colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100) where 360 corresponds to the hue of the color. This allows you to cycle through the colors of the colorwheel 
* It is possible to switch between color modes repeatedly within your sketch. When doing so, the range values will remain unchanged between color modes (If you have (colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100) and you change over to colorMode(RGB) without specifying the range values, then RGB will have the previously set range values of 360, 100, 100). Therefore it is good habit to specify the range values each time that the colorMode() function is used. 


## Alpha (Opacity)
* The fourth argument in a fill() function is the Alpha value or Opacity. 
* You might have heard or seen the term "RGB" before but have you seen or heard "RGBA"? The "A" stands for Alpha
* Every color value can have an opcatiy or alpha value set between 0 and 255 with 0 being completely transparent or invisible and 255 being completely opaque.
* When the Alpha value is omittied in a fill() or stroke() function, the default value of 255 is applied. 
* One interesting effect is setting the background color to include an alpha transparency value between 0 and 255 such as 50. Any graphic element that is drawn to the screen will slowly fade over time. 
* alpha can also be used for layering effects using shapes and colors. 

## Blend Modes
* The blendMode() command sets the type of blending that occurs when two colors are overlaid on top of each other.
* the blendMode() command has many options. The defualt is "BLEND".

`blendMode(ADD)`
`blendMode(SUBTRACT)`
`blendMode(DIFFERENCE)`
`blendMode(EXCLUSION)`
`blendMode(MULTIPLY)`
`blendMode(SCREEN)`
`blendMode(LIGHTEST)`
`blendMode(DARKEST)`
* Try using this code block to test out the different blend modes
```
void setup() {
  size(500, 500);
  background(150);
  noStroke();
}

void draw() {
  //Try changing the contents of blendMode to a different style
  blendMode(DIFFERENCE); 
  
  //fills the ellipse with a random color
  fill(random(255), random(255), random(255), random(255));
  
  //draw an ellipse at a random position within the canvas
  ellipse(random(width), random(height), 100,100);
}
```

... more to come 





## Random Walker
* This excersize introduces the a well rounded algorithym that produces an interesting visual output. It covers all of the basics from declaring variables, to initializing variables in the setup function, to using the random function, and finally using if statements.

```
float x;
float y;

void setup() {
  size(200, 100);
  
  //start in middle of screen
  x = width/2;
  y = height/2;

  //gray background
  background(200);
  
  //make the simulation faster
  frameRate(1000);
}

void draw() {
  
  stroke(0);
  
  //randomly move
  x += random(-1, 1);
  y += random(-1, 1);
  
  //prevent going off left or right
  if(x < 0){
    x = width;
  }
  if(x > width){
    x = 0;
  }

  //prevent going off top or bottom
  if(y < 0){
    y = height;
  }
  if(y > height){
    y = 0;
  }
  
  //draw the point
  point(x, y);
}
```
* Consider how the code could be changed to incorporate color to the walker
* What other elements could be altered for interesting effects?
