# Module 1.5

## Did you know...
* the second(), minute(), hour(), day(), month(), and year() functions return just that which they are named for. note: they are written in singular form
* the map() function takes one value and a range and then maps it over to a new value and range. *map(0.5, 0, 1, 0, 100)* maps the value "0.5" from the range "0 to 1" into the range "0 to 100", and returns the value 50. [map() reference](https://processing.org/reference/map_.html) 

## Color Modes
* The colorMode() function is used to specify which color mode to use inside the processing sketch. There are TWO modes: RGB and HSB
* RGB corresponds to RED/GREEN/BLUE, and is the default color mode [RGB-STYLE CHART](https://ps3.perlenspiel.net/images/rgbrect.png)
* HSB corresponds to HUE/SATURATION/BRIGHTNESS [HSB COLOR WHEEL DIAGRAM](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M0-KLgIQowgQ2sRmRGm%2F-M04eXfov2q8lvkrzSfw%2F-M04ebTAIaSz9auBk8R2%2FHSB_Cone.png?alt=media)
* When changing the color mode with the colorMode function, there is the option of defining a range for each mode's values. For example: colorMode(RGB, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) will make it so that instead of using values between 0 and 255 for each color, you can use values between 0 and 1.0. 
* A common range for HSB values is colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100) where 360 corresponds to the hue of the color. This allows you to cycle through the colors of the colorwheel 
* It is possible to switch between color modes repeatedly within your sketch. When doing so, the range values will remain unchanged between color modes (If you have (colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100) and you change over to colorMode(RGB) without specifying the range values, then RGB will have the previously set range values of 360, 100, 100). Therefore it is good habit to specify the range values each time that the colorMode() function is used. 


## Opacity
* Alter the opacity of graphical elements for interesting effects.
