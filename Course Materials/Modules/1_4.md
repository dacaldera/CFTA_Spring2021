## Math with int and float variables
* number variables can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided anytime and anywhere in your sketch
* Just like in high-school math, the order of operations matter. For example 1 + 5 / 2 is different than (1 + 5) / 2. Parenthesis are used to prioritize certain operations over others. PEMDAS
* To increment a number, assign the number variable to itself plus the increment amount. For example: book_count = book_count + 1
* To increment a number by exactly 1, use the double plus-sign shortcut like this: book_count++. The same applie to subtraction.
* Another shortcut incrementation method is the "+=" operator. book_count += 5 is the same as book_count = book_count + 5. The same applies to subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Variables can be operated other variables. For example:
```
int a = 20; 
int b = 30; 
int c = a * b  // The value of c is 600
```
