## Math with int and float variables
* number variables can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided anytime and anywhere in your sketch
* Just like in high-school math, the order of operations matter. For example 1 + 5 / 2 is different than (1 + 5) / 2. Parenthesis are used to prioritize certain operations over others. PEMDAS
* To increment a number, assign the number variable to itself plus the increment amount. For example: book_count = book_count + 1
* To increment a number by exactly 1, use the double plus-sign shortcut like this: book_count++. The same applie to subtraction.
* Another shortcut incrementation method is the "+=" operator. book_count += 5 is the same as book_count = book_count + 5. The same applies to subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Variables can be operated on by other variables. For example:
```
int a = 20; 
int b = 30; 
int c = a * b  // The value of c is 600
```
* Math operations can be as complex as needed for your particular purpose (example:  x = ( (sqrt(some_value) * 56) / mouseX ) + height - padding ). 
* Many functions are available for operating with numbers. Functions can be included in calculations. Here are just a few examples: (a large list can be found here [java math reference](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17904_01/apirefs.1111/e12048/functmath.htm#CQLLR413) 
```
abs() //returns the positive vale of any number
sqrt() // returns the square root of a number
sq() // returns the value squared
```
