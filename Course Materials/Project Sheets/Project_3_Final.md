In a time when art galleries are doing digital, interactive media displays such as projections and video monitors are becoming commonplace. For this project, design and create a work of art that is to be displayed using a projector on the gallery wall. The theme of the project is open ended as long as it uses the tools and techniques that we have learned in class so far. The visuals can be anything you desire, from geometric and abstract shapes, lines, and colors, to figurative and representational elements such as pictures or video. Your project may incorporate, if desired, a device such as a camera or microphone that captures video or sound to create some sort of interaction.

Steps to take:
* Sketch out an idea using paper and pencil, or mouse/stylus on a drawing app.
* Break your idea down into discrete elements and label them for colors, motion, effect, and/or interaction
* Use pseudo code to plan the main portion of the code, write down the logical steps
* Think about the proper code structure to use (ie functions, classes and objects, etc)
*
