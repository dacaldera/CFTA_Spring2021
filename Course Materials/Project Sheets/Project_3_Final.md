In a time when art galleries are doing digital, interactive media displays such as projections and video monitors are becoming commonplace. For this project, create a work of art that is to be displayed using a projector on the gallery wall. The theme of the project is open ended as long as it uses the tools and techniques that we have learned in class so far. Your project may incorporate, if desired, a device such as a camera or microphone that captures video or sound to create some sort of interaction.
