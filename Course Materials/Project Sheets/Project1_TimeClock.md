# Project 1
## Theme: Time Clock


*Design a ‘visual clock’ that displays a novel or unconventional representation of the time. It is not essential that the time of day be literally readable from it, but your clock should appear different at all times of the day, and it should repeat its appearance every 24 hours (or other relevant cycle, if desired). You are encouraged to question basic assumptions about how time is mediated and represented. Ponder things like biological time (chronobiology), ultradian and infradian rhythms, solar and lunar cycles, celestial time and sidereal time, decimal time, metric time, geological time, historical time, psychological time, and subjective time.*

## Create a sketch that functions like a clock that visualizes the passing of time. 
* The clock need not be round like a real clock, but can be abstract.  
* The sketch should use the time functions that are available in Java and Processing.

## Time Functions: 
* second() [reference](https://processing.org/reference/second_.html) 
* minute() [reference](https://processing.org/reference/minute_.html)
* hour() [reference](https://processing.org/reference/hour_.html)
* day() [reference](https://processing.org/reference/day_.html)
* month() [reference](https://processing.org/reference/month_.html)
* year() [reference](https://processing.org/reference/year_.html)

## The Clock should: 
* inlcude movement, color, and or line that changes with each passing second
* use conditional if() statements to do something interesting at a particular time
